# Proof-of-vote
Proof-of-vote, validators selected by people-vote by Joanna. 

ABSTRACT: Proof-of-vote is a third generation of the Nakamoto consensus. With proof-of-vote, validators compete for people-votes, using proof-of-suffrage given by proof-of-person, and authorize transactions based on authority delegated by the consensus mechanism, just like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. This logical conclusion of the Nakamoto consensus allows a “nation” of people to secure their own ledger, the equivalent of representative democracy for distributed ledger technology.


 
# Introduction
 
The Nakamoto consensus is a majority consensus system based on popular vote. What
distinguishes the different variations of Nakamoto consensus algorithms (such as proof-of-work,
proof-of-stake, or proof-of-vote) is how voting rights are allocated.
 

# Proof-of-stake VS proof-of-vote
 
Overall, in a proof-of-stake network at any given time, you could remove all coins from all
validators, replace those with people-votes in exact same quantity and distribution, and it would
operate identically. The only difference is that the people voting get a share of the transaction
fees

# Validator selection in proof-of-vote 

Validator selection is done by that each validator covers a range of numbers, from 0 to maxIn. Every period (every block in a blockchain), a random number is generated, and the validator that covers that number is selected. To allow for an infinite number of validators, the entities that can be selected are atomic in how many numbers they cover, so that they each cover maxInt/totalEntities numbers. This is done by using the voters, individual people, as the entities that are selected. Voters give their vote to validators, and the voter that is selected by the randomly generated number authorizes their validator for the next period. To compare with existing infrastructure, the voters are analogous to individual miners in a mining pool, and the validator the mining pool. 


The exact mechanism, each person is assigned a unique identifier incrementally from 1, and voters are randomly selected by 1 + randomNumber/(maxInt/getPopulation()). 


The random number generation is done by letting the validators pre-commit hash onions (hash chains that are peeled off gradually) with random numbers, and then submitting their next random number when they are selected for the next period. if(hash(submittedHash) == hashOnion[validator]) randomNumber ^= submittedHash; hashOnion[validator] = submittedHash;. Collusion attacks are prevented by pre-committing a large enough number of hashes at once.
